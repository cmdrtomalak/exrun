# HTML Basics

Learn the fundamentals of semantic HTML5 structure and elements.

## Background

HTML provides the structure and meaning of web content. Using semantic HTML helps with:
- Accessibility (screen readers understand the content structure)
- SEO (search engines better understand your content)
- Maintainability (code is more readable and organized)

## Tasks

Create a simple personal portfolio page in `src/index.html` that includes:

### 1. Basic HTML5 Boilerplate
- DOCTYPE declaration
- html element with lang attribute
- head section with title and meta charset
- body section

### 2. Semantic Structure
- `<header>` element with your name as a heading
- `<nav>` element with navigation links
- `<main>` element for main content
- `<section>` elements for different content areas
- `<footer>` element with copyright info

### 3. Content Elements
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- At least one paragraph
- An unordered list of your skills
- A link to an external website
- An image (you can use a placeholder URL)

## Expected Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Your Name - Portfolio</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Your Name</h1>
        <nav>...</nav>
    </header>
    
    <main>
        <section>...</section>
        <section>...</section>
    </main>
    
    <footer>...</footer>
</body>
</html>
```

## Validation

Your page should be valid HTML5 and use semantic elements appropriately.
